“Comprehensive” list of LaTeX auxiliary files
=============================================

This is the rough beginnings of a document I started 
some time ago and never had the time to finish. The
idea is to list as close to every auxiliary file that
is generated by LaTeX or any 3rd party LaTeX package.

The idea is to include a short description of what 
each file does, its file extension, where it comes 
from (i.e., which package) and whether it’s safe to 
delete.

This work could then be useful as the canonical
reference for writing scripts and exception files
to delete or ignore (etc.) auxiliary LaTeX files
in various contexts (cleanup scripts, version
control configuration, and so on).

I’m putting what I’ve got so far up here in case
some brave soul wishes to continue the work.
